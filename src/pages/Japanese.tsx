          Learning all the 46 hiragana (with the sounds took a little bit of time!) Unlike the video i didnt get it done in an hour
          i wanted to take my time and get the fundimentals built well so i took time making flashcards on paper and testing myself! Doing this i was able to do it in around a day, then the next morning i woke up and was able to pronounce and read all the
          Hiragana kanji, Im so glad i learned it tho! Im sitting here and i can actually pronouce all of the hiragana in songs i like! So im going to move onto reading childrens books in all Hiragan and learn some basic vocab!
